## Config files for Lee Wick production

These are the template files used for generating Lee Wick electrons.  Changes in sensitive information, like event and run numbers handling, as well as slha parameters in the hadronizers can affect the behaviour of the batch submission scripts.  Please check or change them accordingly if proceeding with modifications.
